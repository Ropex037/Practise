                    <img src="img/kartica3.png" alt="card3">

                    <p>In the world of professional services, it's a tough job being an agency owner. There are
                        countless factors to consider in order to grow your business and maintain profitability while
                        providing excellent service for your clients. While running a successful business is hard work,
                        there are certain principles that can make this process easier.</p>

                    <p>In this article, I'll be outlining five key principles that will help you break down barriers and
                        unlock new opportunities as an agency owner/freelancer/ professional services provider, whether
                        you're launching or scaling up your agency. </p>

                    <div>
                        <h3 id="brand">#1 - Brand</h3>

                        <p>It is tough to build. How do you build a brand with no budget? You are a nobody. A lot of
                            people
                            say that having a brand does not matter...especially when you are a small company. Let me
                            tell
                            you something. Brand matters WAY more if you are a smaller company. Don't you get most of
                            your
                            business via referrals?</p>

                        <p>It takes time and every day that goes by without a cohesive branding strategy in place means
                            you
                            are losing potential clients because they see your business as unprofessional or unfocused.
                            You
                            need a process of building your brand: create a strategy, design, content creation, and
                            deployment.</p>

                        <p>I read this post once that stated, you start to build a brand when you stand for something in
                            your field of work. At Growth Rhino we truly believe outbound is broken and want to help
                            SaaS
                            companies with their respective programs.</p>

                        <p>Branding is what sets you apart from your competition and it's how people identify with your
                            company or organization. When done right, branding can take a new idea and turn it into an
                            internationally-recognized brand that people love. </p>

                        <p style="border-left: 3px solid black; padding-left: 2%;"> A strong brand will help establish
                            trust
                            with clients who
                            are looking for someone they can work
                            with long-term on something they truly believe in. </p>
                        <p style="border-left: 3px solid black; padding-left: 2%;"> A strong brand will allow you access
                            to
                            more clients because there is already recognition when someone sees that name or logo, which
                            means less marketing required for initial sales.</p>

                        <p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Brand hack:</span> Go have 100 conversations about your
                            topic. Do
                            100 podcast interviews,
                            articles or
                            Linkedin Posts. I guarantee you after that , people will know what your brand stands for.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h3 id="Subject">#2 - Subject Matter Expertise</h3>

                        <p>This translates simply into people wanting to work with the best. What's your business all
                            about?
                            Do you know? It doesn’t matter if you have a 100 dollar engagement or 100 million. You can
                            build
                            this by producing content and talking about your differentiation. The key here is to produce
                            relevant evergreen content that you can repurpose in your sales cycle.</p>

                        <p>Subject matter expertise matters for the success of your agency and the importance of being
                            an
                            expert in your field cannot be overstated. It's important that clients feel they're getting
                            top-tier service when they come to you with their marketing needs, and it’s also important
                            that
                            your employees believe in the work they are doing. When people don't have subject matter
                            expertise or are working in unfamiliar territory, there can be a lack of buy-in from both
                            parties involved as well as decreased productivity due to frequent mistakes and wasted time
                            spent on unnecessary parts of the business. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3 id="force">#3 - Can't Force The Need</h3>

                        <p>This is probably the biggest misconception any service provider has. Only 2% of your buyers
                            are
                            in ready to buy mode. The rest are not even aware of the problem they have. No matter how
                            many
                            emails, phone calls or free events you throw, if that person doesn't have a need they cannot
                            engage you for your service.</p>

                        <p>We all know that the need for our services isn't always there and it's frustrating when we
                            can't
                            get clients to buy into what we do enough to sign on.</p>

                        <p>If you're a consultant or agency owner, you've probably heard the question before: 'How do I
                            get
                            my boss to buy your services?' The answer is simple. You can't. It's not that our services
                            are
                            so great and we're just waiting for people to see how smart we are. It's because there's no
                            way
                            of forcing someone else into using something they don't want. Here's why you can't force the
                            need: </p>

                        <p>You'll burn yourself out if you try too hard, it takes time (and luck!) to develop a client
                            base.
                            Focus your energy on other parts of your business instead of trying to drum up work
                            constantly.
                        </p>

                        <p>It will seem desperate and unprofessional, you want potential clients to think highly of your
                            branding right off the bat which means not seeming like someone who will sell their soul for
                            a
                            client</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3 id="nature">#4 - Nurture</h3>

                        <p>Staying top of mind with your existing network is what will help you the most. Nurture your
                            network. This is a phrase I've heard many times and can't seem to shake. It's like the old
                            adage
                            "it takes one person to make a difference." The more people you know, the more opportunities
                            you
                            have for work, connections, or even friendships. But how do you nurture this network? </p>

                        <p>You stay top of mind by posting on Linkedin, starting a private/company newsletter, reaching
                            out
                            to your network and scheduling catch up calls. You need to think like a media company and be
                            everywhere where your prospect is.</p>

                        <p>It's hard to stay top of mind in a business filled with competition. When talking about
                            nurturing, I’m not saying to treat them like children, but keep an open line of
                            communication,
                            provide consistent value, and be there when they need you most. Nurturing doesn't happen
                            overnight, it takes time and effort, but the outcome will be worth it! </p>>
                    </div>
                    <div class="Relationships">
                        <h3 id="relShip">#5 - Relationships</h3>
                        <p>Don't focus on MQLs, SQLs, and all other metrics. The only metric in lead generation for a
                            service provider that matters is relevant relationships. Optimize your funnel to start more
                            conversations that will help you build more relationships. Then you stay top of mind across
                            those relationships.</p>

                        <p>A few more tips:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Get out there!</li>
                            <li>Find people you trust and connect with them</li>
                            <li>Be ready to share your skills</li>
                            <li>Be open-minded about new connections</li>
                            <li>Keep it real</li>
                            <li>Offer help when you can</li>
                            <li>Make time for others</li>
                            <li>Create a blog (content)</li>
                            <li>Write guest posts to share what you know</li>
                            <li>Think of networking as an investment in yourself and business</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>Building relationships for your business is easy if you are creating conversations in your
                            area of expertise and interacting with your ideal audience.</p>

                        <p>You can build a predictable and scalable pipeline can be possible once you build a process
                            around the above.</p>

                        <p>In short you need to take a stance, be producing content, building new relationships and
                            maintaining existing ones. That is how you will build your agency.</p>

                        <p>One relationship at a time.</p>
